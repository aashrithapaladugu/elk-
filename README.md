In the rapidly evolving environment of modern networks, maintaining robust security, optimizing 
performance, and gaining visibility into network activity are paramount. Network administrators and 
security experts rely on advanced tools and frameworks to address these challenges. One such 
powerful synergy results from the integration of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) 
with Zeek (formerly known as Bro), a high-performance network analysis framework. This integration 
offers a comprehensive solution for capturing, analyzing and visualizing network data, providing 
invaluable insights to improve network management, security and decision making
